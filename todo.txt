String stuff:
    Make the string guesser less agressive
    Option to disallow guessing a string if the word happens to be valid as a Vram on the current segment
    Consider removing the string guesser from the preheater
    Fix "autogenerated by" on some strings
        Is this still an issue?

Does the following pattern make sense with a pointer?
    /* 00C140 0001B940 B800A68F */  lw          $a2, 0xB8($sp)

    /* 00C158 0001B958 F00FC630 */  andi        $a2, $a2, 0xFF0
    /* 00C15C 0001B95C F00FC638 */  xori        $a2, $a2, 0xFF0
    /* 00C160 0001B960 02310600 */  srl         $a2, $a2, 4
    /* 00C164 0001B964 00420600 */  sll         $t0, $a2, 8
    /* 00C168 0001B968 2530C800 */  or          $a2, $a2, $t0
    /* 00C16C 0001B96C 00420800 */  sll         $t0, $t0, 8
    /* 00C170 0001B970 2530C800 */  or          $a2, $a2, $t0

    /* 00C174 0001B974 00FF083C */  lui         $t0, %hi(UNK_FF000001)
    /* 00C178 0001B978 2530C800 */  or          $a2, $a2, $t0
    /* 00C17C 0001B97C 0100C624 */  addiu       $a2, $a2, %lo(UNK_FF000001)

Consider allowing user-defined data layouts using the same syntax as python's struct package
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html

Add an addresslabel/abslabel/whaterver.
    Generic way to namify an address.
    Use it for name_ends and `.NON_MATCHING` symbols

Allow executable sections to have symbols being disassembled as data

Change the order of checks in InstructionAnalysisResult::process_instr
    Check and_link before everything else

Some functions may end with `jr` with a non-$ra register that hasn't loaded a jumptable either.

Rename noload to nobits

function end checker: when checking for branches see if the branch is a link one

negative unconditional branch may end the current function
