String stuff:
    Make the string guesser less agressive
    Allow string guesser to allow strings referenced with lwl/lwr+sh/sb/etc
    Option to disallow guessing a string if the word happens to be valid as a Vram on the current segment
    Consider removing the string guesser from the preheater
    Fix "autogenerated by" on some strings

Does the following pattern make sense with a pointer?
    /* 00C140 0001B940 B800A68F */  lw          $a2, 0xB8($sp)

    /* 00C158 0001B958 F00FC630 */  andi        $a2, $a2, 0xFF0
    /* 00C15C 0001B95C F00FC638 */  xori        $a2, $a2, 0xFF0
    /* 00C160 0001B960 02310600 */  srl         $a2, $a2, 4
    /* 00C164 0001B964 00420600 */  sll         $t0, $a2, 8
    /* 00C168 0001B968 2530C800 */  or          $a2, $a2, $t0

    /* 00C174 0001B974 00FF083C */  lui         $t0, %hi(UNK_FF000001)

Consider allowing user-defined data layouts using the same syntax as python's struct package
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html

Missing validations:
    Duplicated names on overlay segments
    Section was preheated
    Section is not prehated twice
    Section is not created twice

Look up for ` -> &str` uses and consider changing them for `Arc<str>`
