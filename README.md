spimdisasm (whole name is lowercase) is a matching MIPS disassembler API with
built-in instruction analysis.

Currently supports the instruction set for MIPS I, II, III and IV.

Mainly focused on supporting binaries from videogame platforms like the
Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable.

A matching disassembler generates assembly that can be assembled back into the
same original binary it was produced from, performing a clean round-trip.

## Features

- Produces matching assembly.
- Supports `.text`, `.data`, `.rodata` and `.bss` disassembly.
- Generates separated files for each section of a file (`.text`, `.data`,
  `.rodata` and `.bss`).
- Supports spliting multiple assembly files from a single input binary.
- Automatic function detection.
  - Can detect the limits of when a function starts and end with pretty high
    success rate.
  - Can detect if a function is handwritten too to a certain degree.
- Can identify symbols identification and actually symbolize them for a more
  flexible generated assembly.
- Reloc pairing (i.e. `%hi`/`%lo` relocs) with high success rate.
- Function spliting with rodata migration.
- Supports inference of multiple data types, like floats, doubles, strings,
  jumptables, bytes and shorts.
- String detection with medium to high success rate.
- Allows to set user-defined symbol metadata, like names, type, sizes, etc.
- Support for big and little endian.
- Autogenerated symbols can be named after the section they come from (`RO_` and
  `B_` for `.rodata` and `.bss` sections) or its type (`STR_`, `FLT_` and `DBL_`
  for string, floats and doubles respectively).
- Simple file boundary detection.
  - Detects boundaries on .text and .rodata sections.
- Very customizable: Many features can be toggled on and off.
- MIPS instructions features:
  - Named registers for MIPS VR4300's coprocessors.
  - Support for many pseudoinstructions.
  - Properly handle move to/from coprocessor instructions.
  - Support for o32, n32, n64, eabi32 and eabi64 ABI register names.
- Some workarounds for some specific compilers/assemblers:
  - `SN64`/`PSYQ`:
    - `div`/`divu` fix: tweaks a bit the produced `div`, `divu` and `break` instructions.
- Support for specific MIPS instruction set extensions:
  - N64's RSP instruction disassembly support.
    - RSP decoding has been tested to build back to matching assemblies with
      [armips](https://github.com/Kingcom/armips/).
  - PS1's R3000 GTE instruction set support.
  - PSP's R4000 ALLEGREX instruction set support.
  - PS2's R5900 EE instruction set support.
- Support for disassembling sections with overlapping addresses.

## Installation

spimdisasm is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/spimdisasm) and
can be included in your Cargo enabled project like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
spimdisasm = "2.0.0-alpha.1"
```

For more details and feature configuration, consult the
[Rust-specific README](src/spimdisasm/README.md#installation).

<!--
## Installing

The recommended way to install is using from the PyPi release, via `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U spimdisasm
```

If you use a `requirements.txt` file in your repository, then you can add
this library with the following line:

```txt
spimdisasm>=1.30.2,<2.0.0
```

### Development version

The unstable development version is located at the [develop](https://github.com/Decompollaborate/spimdisasm/tree/develop)
branch. PRs should be made into that branch instead of the main one.

The recommended way to install a locally cloned repo is by passing the `-e`
(editable) flag to `pip`.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

In case you want to mess with the latest development version without wanting to
clone the repository, then you could use the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip uninstall spimdisasm
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Decompollaborate/spimdisasm.git@develop
```

NOTE: Installing the development version is not recommended unless you know what
you are doing. Proceed at your own risk.

## Versioning and changelog

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
We try to always keep backwards compatibility, so no breaking changes should
happen until a major release (i.e. jumping from 1.X.X to 2.0.0).

To see what changed on each release check either the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
file or check the [releases page on Github](https://github.com/Decompollaborate/spimdisasm/releases).
You can also use [this link](https://github.com/Decompollaborate/spimdisasm/releases/latest)
to check the latest release.

<!--
## How to use

This repo can be used either by using the existing front-end scripts or by
creating new programs on top of the back-end API.

### Front-end

Every front-end CLI tool has its own `--help` screen.

The included tool can be executed with either `spimdisasm modulename` (for
example `spimdisasm disasmdis --help`) or directly `modulename` (for example
`spimdisasm --help`)

- `singleFileDisasm`: Allows to disassemble a single binary file, producing
  matching assembly files.

- `disasmdis`: Disassembles raw hex passed to the CLI as a MIPS instruction.

- `elfObjDisasm`: \[EXPERIMENTAL\] Allows to disassemble elf files. Generated
  assembly files are not guaranteed to match or even be assemblable.

- `rspDisasm`: Disassemblies RSP binaries.

### Back-end

TODO

Check the already existing front-ends is recommended for now.
